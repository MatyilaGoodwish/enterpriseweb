        <h1>Struggling with design consistency for a new website</h1>
        <h2>Planning the right way to avoid re-design</h2>
        <p>
            Getting a design that inspires your products and services is not relatively cheap, it takes time also money with lots of reviews to get it right, the feeling of it not working as expected might bring a lot of stress for managers, planning it for the long run helps when customers become familiar with the brand you want to keep it just like that, many customers don’t like change that much it signals something is wrong, if something changes visually it might mean the business has changed or the service quality is affected.

        <h3>Quality of the draft</h3>
        <p>
            It many cases the draft is often a sketchy looking rough idea of the final concept, but for some, it might be just the beginning of a great concept but just how does one know it is now ready to help the creatives wrap up the idea, both designers and managers need to effectively communicate the right concept and ideas, also managers need to thoroughly explain what needs to be done to help their company brand, if designers get this wrong the whole concept fails before it even starts.
        </p>

        <h3>Meeting the right criteria</h3>
        <p>
            It matters to attain feedback for every experience through observation of how the public first glance is towards any creative work, getting the right colors, contrasting images together may help companies show off more richness depending on the products themselves, i.e if you are business selling variety of goods and services online you may want to consider layout of products, high-quality images in thumbnail sizes and compressed gallery photos for enhancing site speed, but if customers see the product with good product copy but have bad experience with the whole shopping experience because of poorly designed promos, special offers you may end up not meeting the right criteria signaling a failing strategy.
