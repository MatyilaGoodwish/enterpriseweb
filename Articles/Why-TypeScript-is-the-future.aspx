        <h1>Why TypeScript is the future?</h1>
        <h2>Learning JavaScript is beneficial but documentation makes you organized</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is the topic here even though it says TypeScript is the future, here is why TypeScript as a transpiler makes sense for JavaScript developers, firstly JavaScript is a fast-growing programming language for the web, desktop, mobile including server-side technologies such as .NET or NodeJS, also serverless technologies use JavaScript in popular MEAN stack where AngularJS is the front alongside other tools, runtimes, and client-side frameworks use JavaScript
        </p>

        <p>
            It all comes to a single question for JavaScript developers so why TypeScript is the future is the reason that makes it so good to work within first place, working with any programming language on multiple projects requires production output after all the development has completed initial stage, so much that testing becomes much harder if you new to the language unless you know what you are doing, using modern features of JavaScript is the key with using TypeScript, also making use of modern features along with strong types allows easier documentation for professional coding.
        </p>

        <h3>Why it came in first place</h3>
        <p>
            Typescript why did came in first place was to resolve many issues will learning how to program effectively writing code, working within a team can be very difficult especially if a team doesn’t get along as much we have a lot of differences in the areas that we specialise in choosing a programming language is a personal choice at first, when joining corporate environment we have to adhere to the standards such as good quality and clean code, one of the main aspects of writing code is documentation typescript helps with documentation many have heard this but they’re not really sure how it actually works
        </p>

        <h3>Documentation</h3>
        <p>
            Well there are ways to generate good documentation out of your JavaScript files the documentation will have eventually in HTML output with all the types and annotations and return types all documented in just a single click if you write in typescript documentation becomes easier and a whole lot simple if you already used to write clean code we also encourage people to use typescript to avoid making errors or writing bugs, a lot can go wrong when writing any scripting languages it is much easier for other people to read a properly documented program so if you writing programs but other people can work with without making other people’s lives miserable then you have a whole lot of opportunities ahead of you
        </p>

        <h3>Downsides to poorly written code</h3>
        <p>
            If you’re writing code that only you can understand not because other people don’t know how to write good programs, you are setting yourself to fail there are many opportunities but no one is willing to take the risk with untested code so as part of this writing unit test also it’s very important it saves the company from tech debt,
        </p>

        <h3>Next steps</h3>
        <p>
            Encouraging your team to always write unit tests improve the standard of your company also enforces rules that every team member has to follow in order to write good quality production programs, when we write software we want programs that work we want programs that deliver our clients are not paying for errors or downtimes we expect superior in premium quality every time we cannot compromise on quality nor can be compromised or the delivery time for all the promised dates, typescript makes this very easy for us it ensures that all the JavaScript that we write in office is of high quality we encourage you to try typescript for a small project and see how it scales after all typescript is valid JavaScript
