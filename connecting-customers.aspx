            Having a website is one way to connect to customers anywhere in the world,
            many websites online serve a single purpose which is to drive sales or express a specific goal,
            some companies may need to adjust their websites by engaging content that is relevant to its clients,
            companies adding content to their websites help customers to develop new interests on a particular service or product,
            if a customer visits a business websites for the first time what do you think is the intent of this customer?

        <h3>What goes on in the mind</h3>
        <p>
            Websites we visit are not in memory we always search the web often looking for something,
            why does it matter so much what we find online because we have different interests,
            internet giants will keep updating their websites to show relevant information, 
            many companies will do this because they need to increase profits to favor business practices,
            while it makes perfect sense for startups to hire the best developers,
            online success is not always about having the best developers but by how much of what is good can truly benefit the customer,
            in this case a visitor that hates ads will quickly exist the website, 
            websites should offer quality content that engage readers, many people will confirm that they don't waste
            their data with just any website, also that if someone ends up on your website it truly means your website has the information
