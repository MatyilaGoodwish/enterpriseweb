                 There is an urge that everybody likes to resist when it comes to looking good, 
                 helping relationships last longer with just using the way one looks around those that appreciate them,
                 it's who you are for them but it's what you look like, can you stand out from the pack of women trying to snatch and scratch?
             </p>
             <h2>Unfolding fashion trends that last forever in his eyes</h2>
             <p>
                 Learn by doing then teach him where to make it worth your while, it goes without saying a compliment shines brighter than the sun,
                 they like to be engaged with fun humour conversations that last for hours, some may not be into just talking but how you look sets the score for a new day

             <h3>Have you decided what works best on him?</h3>
             <p>
                 There is a place of silence within every one of them, in order to completely understand their thoughts you have to send the right message to the right gentlemen,
                 it's not as complicated as you might think here is a goal think fashion week or trip to the beach, what will you wear if you single? How would you attract your high potentials if they just walked by without saying hello,
                 it's in those jeans that caught the attention of many of them trying to ignore the obvious, but inside they cry out loud with an animal instict that can snatch and eat a lion alive, so much appetite for the cakes that seem to be working harder to find the right way to deliver the right design for that right pair of high weist jeans.

             <h3>Feeling like you losing color?</h3>
             <p>
                 You too may own a washing machine but does not have to be on your body,
                 the best shape is the one that has smooth edges right curves not corners, 
                 if that happens then they getting into that 1981 trend that you can blame for 20% of divorce rates,
                 are you losing color or touch? it depends on what you wear consistently, anything overworn can be overly torn apart by shrugging,
                 make no mistake this is not fashion but a bad design rule from an underpaid tailor with no sense of creativity,
                 it's never mean't to make you accept, you just have to live with getting your audience to respect your designs... goes without saying,
                 you need a good angle to showcase your work, one that is effective and targeting to the right fashion trends.
