                        find the right starting point in this case let's look at an example: Let's say you own an accounts firm one way clients contact you already is through a telephone or by email an online presence can help clients
                        find you online, ensuring that when your clients get online you have a strategy to capture what the client needs is to have ready call to actions on the website,
                        all call to actions help the customer make informed decisions about getting intouch with your company.

                    <h3 class="display-4">Definitive Local business listing should be first</h3>
                    <p>
                        Before throwing your company budget around it is best to try local business listings, that doesn't say you should not have a doman in your name for sending emails
                        , there are domain only plans with companies such as Afrihost in the country, <a href="https://www.afrihost.com/site/product/domain_email">see Afrihost domain email offering for your business</a> this will help you send business emails to your client using your business name instead of free email services like gmail or yahoo,
                        you want to build trust with your clients set your business apart from the SPAM society of free email services this also gives you time to plan your website design in time,
                        rushing to have a website without a clear plan is wrong in so many ways also it can lead to poor business decisions that impact your company in the future.
